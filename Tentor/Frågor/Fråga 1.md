- **A container is an instance of an image,** 
	  The Docker image is a collection of files that constitute a tiny component of the operating system necessary to execute the Docker container as a standalone unit on any host.
	
- **A container is an enviorment for isolated processes, the container have its own filesystem** 
- **The container shares the host kernel**

- **namespaces**:
	  
- **control groups**:
  
- **capabilities**:
  
- **secure computing mode**:
