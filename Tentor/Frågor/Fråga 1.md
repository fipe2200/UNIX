What it is:
- **A container is an instance of an image,** 
	  The Docker image is a collection of files that constitute a tiny component of the operating system necessary to execute the Docker container as a standalone unit on any host.
	
- **A container is an enviorment for isolated processes, the container have its own filesystem** 
- **The container shares the host kernel**


How it works:
You need a docker engine (like docker) to manage containers, the docker deamon process manages the containers,  


Compared to a virtual machine:


Usage examples:

Containers are useful for several cases :

**Web development:**  Containers are a great choice since they are lightweight and are easy to deploy in a variety of environments such as development staging and production. 
**Cloud computing:** Are easy to scale up and scale down to meet the demand. 
**Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD):** Containers are used for automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

A useful case for Virtual machines (VM)

**Testing:** Virtual machines are great to test new software in a safe environment if the software breaks the system you can restart the VM or just start a new VM. Since VM are isolated it won't risk it's surrounding
