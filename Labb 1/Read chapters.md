## Summary

### 11 - Drivers and the Kernel

### 11.1 Kernel chores for system administrators
```
The kernel is mainly written in C with some assembly language for CPU-specific functions. While you don't need to be a C programmer to manage systems, you may occasionally need to adjust kernel settings, often through tuning parameters or by installing new device drivers. In some cases, building a new kernel version might be necessary, though it’s now less common. Be cautious with kernel changes, as even minor tweaks can destabilize performance; always have a backup plan.
```
### 11.2 Kernel version numbering
```
The Linux and FreeBSD kernels are continuously developed, with bug fixes, new features, and occasional removals of outdated features. Linux distributions vary in kernel versions, balancing stability with the latest features. Linux kernels have their own semantic versioning, but stability is not always linked to version numbers.
Some distributions may use older, more stable kernels for reliability. FreeBSD, on the other hand, maintains two main versions—one focused on stability and the other on active development. It releases stable updates frequently, expecting users to keep up with patching to maintain security and functionality.
